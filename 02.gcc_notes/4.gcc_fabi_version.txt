fabi-version
Instructs the compiler to select a specific ABI implementation.

Arguments
n

Is the ABI implementation. Possible values are:
0 Requests the latest ABI implementation.
1 Requests the ABI implementation used in gcc 3.2 and gcc 3.3.
2 Requests the ABI implementation used in gcc 3.4 and higher.

Description
This option tells the compiler to select a specific ABI implementation. This option is compatible with gcc option -fabi-version. If you have multiple versions of gcc installed, the compiler may change the value of n depending on which gcc is detected in your path.

NOTE
gcc 3.2 and 3.3 are not fully ABI-compliant, but gcc 3.4 is highly ABI-compliant.

CAUTION
Do not mix different values for -fabi-version in one link.
